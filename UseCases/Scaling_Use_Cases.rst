HA Scenario Analysis
====================

Scaling use cases
-----------------

Generally, traffic loads may vary with bursts and spikes of traffic according to external events, and network resource failures may reduce the available resources to process existing load adequately. What mentioned above can be summarize as service quality is no longer acceptable, requiring expanding capacity.Thereby, Service Providers use dynamic scaling out of VNFs to ensure that HA is maintained.

Scaling in and scaling down are not so HA related, scaling up needs to stop the services which cannot meet the strict Carrier-Grade requirements. So we just talk about scaling out here.

The scaling out use cases can be grouped in 3 categories:

    * Scaling triggered by VNF Manager. VNFM receives notifications and triggers the scaling operation when certain conditions are met. Notifications come from infrastructure-level and VNF-level events. Infrastructure-level events are generated by the VIM. VNF-Level events may be generated by the VNF instance or its EM.

    * Scaling triggered by VNF itself or its EM. A VNF instance or its EM monitor the VNF instance and trigger a scaling operation by sending request to the VNFM when certain conditions are met.

    * Scaling triggered by OSS/BSS. In this case, scaling is based on management request. OSS/BSS send scaling request to VNFM via NFVO.

Scaling triggered by VNF Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. VNFM collects performance measurement results from VNF and/or EM, this is application specific.

    2. VNFM detects a capacity shortage which requires scaling out.

    3. VNFM cooperates with NFVO to finally make a scaling decision. This process includes confirming the specifications listed in the VNFD (CPU, Memory, IP, etc.), checking the availability of the resources requested for scaling, saving the scaling information and resources reservation (optionally).

    4. VNFM sends request to VIM for allocating resources needed for scaling.

    5. VIM validates the request and creates and starts the needed new compute, storage and network (include the network connection) resources, then acknowledges the completion of allocating resources to the VNFM.

    6. VNFM configures VNF data specific for VNF instantiation.

    7. VNFM notifies EM that a scaled VNF is existed.

    8. EM and VNFM update the VNF as managed device.

    9. EM configures VNF with application specific parameters.

    10. VNFM reports the success of scaling to NFVO. NFVO now is aware that the configuration of the newly scaled VNF is instantiated.

    11. NFVO maps the VNF to the proper VIM and resource pool.

Scaling triggered by VNF itself or its EM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. Manual Operatorâ€™s request or automatic event to expand the capacity of a VNF. Automatic event here can be the situations that some certain conditions are met when traffic overloaded or network resource failures.

    2. VNF or its EM requests scaling to VNFM.

    3. VNFM cooperates with NFVO to finally make a scaling decision. This process includes confirming the specifications listed in the VNFD (CPU, Memory, IP, etc.), checking the availability of the resources requested for scaling, saving the scaling information and resources reservation (optionally).

    4. VNFM sends request to VIM for allocating resources needed for scaling.

    5. VIM validates the request and creates and starts the needed new compute, storage and network (include the networkconnection) resources, then acknowledges the completion of allocating resources to the VNFM.

    6. VNFM configures VNF data specific for VNF instantiation.

    7. VNFM notifies EM that a scaled VNF is existed.

    8. EM and VNFM update the VNF as managed device.

    9. EM configures VNF with application specific parameters.

    10. VNFM reports the success of scaling to NFVO. NFVO now is aware that the configuration of the newly scaled VNF is instantiated.

    11. NFVO maps the VNF to the proper VIM and resource pool.

Scaling triggered by OSS/BSS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. OSS/BSS sends scaling request to NFVO for some management demand.

    2. NFVO validates the request and finds the related VNFM and sends the scaling request to VNFM.

    3. VNFM cooperates with NFVO to finally make a scaling decision. This process includes confirming the specifications listed in the VNFD (CPU, Memory, IP, etc.), checking the availability of the resources requested for scaling, saving the scaling information and resources reservation (optionally).

    4. VNFM sends request to VIM for allocating resources needed for scaling.

    5. VIM validates the request and creates and starts the needed new compute, storage and network (include the networkconnection) resources, then acknowledges the completion of allocating resources to the VNFM.

    6. VNFM configures VNF data specific for VNF instantiation.

    7. VNFM notifies EM that a scaled VNF is existed.

    8. EM and VNFM update the VNF as managed device.

    9. EM configures VNF with application specific parameters.

    10. VNFM reports the success of scaling to NFVO. NFVO now is aware that the configuration of the newly scaled VNF is instantiated.

    11. NFVO maps the VNF to the proper VIM and resource pool.

    12. NFVO reports the success of scaling to OSS/BSS.
