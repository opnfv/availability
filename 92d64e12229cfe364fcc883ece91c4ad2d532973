In the last case the hypervisor and the OS are not responsible for the reporting to the VIM.\nAnd of course a failed hypervisor or OS cannot report its own failure, so this again points to the clustering.\n\nNow below you elaborate some cases, so there is an overlap.

      "message": "What I have in mind is the NFVI include the host OS. Currently lots of HW fault can be reported to the host OS, which is called in-band mechanism. Therefore, the Host OS should have the capability to report actively to the VIM, or provide interface so that the VIM can get the report. There are also other mechanisms for the HW to report out-band, which will not report to the host OS but to another HW management system. This is the case we have seen for the DELL HW. In this case I think the HW management system can be considered as part of the VIM and should provide interface to the Openstack, which is also exactly the case for DELL HW. \nSo for this Item, I think we can require the in-band mechanism, which means the NFVI should be capable of reporting the HW in-band failure report to the VIM. Such capability can be either active or passive.\nFor the NFVI failure report part, I agree a failed NFVI can\u0027t report its own fault to the VIM. Therefore, it should be the VIM\u0027s responsibility to detect that fault. This may require an interface from the NFVI to the VIM.\nI also think we should put these two into two requirement and make it clear.\nWhat do you think?",
