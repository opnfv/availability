In fact, one could deploy both compute and network VNFs on the same host, right? Perhaps just saying the HA protection for the Network Nodes may be the same as for the Compute Nodes would address it.\n\nAlso, aren\u0027t some of these apps run on the Controller normally, like DHCP?\n\nAnother network-specific thing that could be added is that all hosts should have at least two NICs that are bonded via LACP.",

There\u0027s also an experimental feature to use a shared block volume, but it\u0027s definitely not as shown.\n\nActually, Cinder manager and drivers operate on the controller nodes, too. If this is a Hyper-converged or Server SAN type implementation then the storage is part of the Compute Nodes and would actually be a victim of that protection (e.g., lose a host, and you lose all the data on that host, which causes rebalancing of storage across remaining nodes). \n\nI have found the Server SAN more common, or at least as common, so far in POCs. However, for cases where there is a dense storage requirement, then the storage service itself provides HA. It may be distributed (think segregated Ceph servers), or it may be through redundancy and data protection built into a storage array.",

Because there are always multiple answers to the question of \"how\", which I think is the intent of the second part of this doc. Does specifying PaceMaker here rule out the use keepalived as an HA strategy in OPNFV?\n\nBut creating the segmentations for the different areas of HA in the first part is only of marginal value, isn\u0027t it?
