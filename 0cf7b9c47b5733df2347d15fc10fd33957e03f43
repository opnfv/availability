      "message": "I have checked out with several Hardware vendors, and it seems that this time constraint should be different for various hardware failure. However, I do think the immidiate notification of HW failure to the VIM is necessary since timely failover of VNF can be triggered. Maybe we can put this requirement as follows:\nHardware failure should be detected and notified to the VIM within seconds. Specific time constraint should be based on the failure type and the failed instance.",
