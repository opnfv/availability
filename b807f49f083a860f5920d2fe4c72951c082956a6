      "message": "Grammar comment: In the requirements instead of \"will\" I would use \"shall\", \"should\", or \"must\" as appropriate.\n\nGeneral comment: Whenever the hypervisor or host OS should report something to the VIM that makes it \"NFV-aware\". Is that what we want? Shouldn\u0027t we rather require more generic capabilities that allows for extension/configuration of the capability? \nE.g. a hypervisor must have the capability of reporting HW errors. It should be possible to configure the destination address of the error reports.\n\nOn the other hand when it comes to distributed storage if I understand correctly we do consider certain host OS/hypervisor \"extensions\". Maybe that\u0027s the case for the networking as well. \nSo maybe the best to have some description in the section that explain these: I.e. what can be generic and what requires extensions and place the requirements accordingly. With such explanation many of my comments/questions may go away.",

      "message": "what I want to indicate for this requirement is:\nonce there is a failure happens at the HW, the hypervisor should do the possible recovery by itself, e.g., evacuate all the VM on this host. Such revocery should be done by the hypervisor itself rather than report to the VIM and wait until the VIM giving further orders for evacuation. This is beneficial because it will be a distributed hypervisor HA solution, and the failure of VIM will have low influence on the hypervisor HA.\nI will modify this item as follows to make it more specific. See if the following requirements work for you?\n\n\"The hypervisor should support distrubited HA mechenism so that when hardware or host failure happens, the hypervisor can revocer itself without any instruction from the VIM.\"\n\n\"The hypervisor should report its failure and recovery action to the VIM.\"",
