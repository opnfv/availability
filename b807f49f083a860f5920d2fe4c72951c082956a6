      "message": "Grammar comment: In the requirements instead of \"will\" I would use \"shall\", \"should\", or \"must\" as appropriate.\n\nGeneral comment: Whenever the hypervisor or host OS should report something to the VIM that makes it \"NFV-aware\". Is that what we want? Shouldn\u0027t we rather require more generic capabilities that allows for extension/configuration of the capability? \nE.g. a hypervisor must have the capability of reporting HW errors. It should be possible to configure the destination address of the error reports.\n\nOn the other hand when it comes to distributed storage if I understand correctly we do consider certain host OS/hypervisor \"extensions\". Maybe that\u0027s the case for the networking as well. \nSo maybe the best to have some description in the section that explain these: I.e. what can be generic and what requires extensions and place the requirements accordingly. With such explanation many of my comments/questions may go away.",
