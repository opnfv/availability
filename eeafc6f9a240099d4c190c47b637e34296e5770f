But when discussing HA, you do not want to be limited to restore from a backup, but you want to continue to provide service seamlessly (as seamless as necessary/promised). Here you may need (as already written) different techniques to propagate state",

      "message": "The comment was with respect to the Multi-Site document that the term Geo Redundancy was taken from (that\u0027s where I was saying I would add another comment). Anyway, this is referred to as Disaster Recovery. Geo--Distributed Disaster Recovery is another form which provides for recovery in multiple locations. But true Geo Redundancy is something like an Active-Active metro wide cluster, though I\u0027ve never heard that called either Geo Redundancy, either. Active-Active Metro offers more than DR obviously, but the point of my comment was simply to use a more commonly used name. A very valid and important use case, for sure, but simply known more widely as Disaster Recovery.",
