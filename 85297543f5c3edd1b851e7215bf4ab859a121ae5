What I would do is to describe \n- what failures we should consider in case of network nodes\n- how each of these parts are deployed (i.e. architecture) for HA\n- how they (should) behave in case of the different failures that we said we should consider",

      "message": "As I mentioned in the mailing list, what deployed in the network nodes from my side are networking services which are like the services deployed in the control nodes. So the deployment for HA can be the same, that is what have been done in installer projects. There is no network node now. All the failures can be summarized as HW failure and SW failure, all most the same as control nodes, right? So I think there is no need to add a independent use case for network node. There is nothing special. In another way, why don\u0027t we add a use case for control node?",

      "message": "I think what Yifei explains is the deployment case where we have all the neotron service deployed on the control node. But we could also deploy stand alone network nodes with multiple neotrol agents deployed on them. Such deployment is often used and also is suggested to be used, so that the network load will not waste too much resource of the control node. I think such case should be deployed here in this section.",

      "message": "I think we may need a whole picture of the network node deployment before we go into such details. This is a scenario analysis doc rather than a gap analysis doc. I think Maria\u0027s part gives us a good example of how to analysis the scenarios. What I expect here is also, we could explain how to deploy the network nodes so that they are high available. These details can be discussed. But I think a big picture should be discribed first so that the readers will know what HA network node deployment should be.",
