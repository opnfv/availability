What I would do is to describe \n- what failures we should consider in case of network nodes\n- how each of these parts are deployed (i.e. architecture) for HA\n- how they (should) behave in case of the different failures that we said we should consider",

      "message": "I think we may need a whole picture of the network node deployment before we go into such details. This is a scenario analysis doc rather than a gap analysis doc. I think Maria\u0027s part gives us a good example of how to analysis the scenarios. What I expect here is also, we could explain how to deploy the network nodes so that they are high available. These details can be discussed. But I think a big picture should be discribed first so that the readers will know what HA network node deployment should be.",
